# Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality ([[book]](https://hpmor.com/))

(*Note: To summarize the book, I'm keeping track of all interesting concepts and the context they were mentioned in. Some concepts I was aware of before reading the book, but it's still a good practice to document them since that forces me to think through the context they were mentioned in.*)

## Volume 1: The Methods of Rationality — Chapters 1 - 21

| Concept | Explanation | Context |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The scientific method (Also: the Baconian method) | Hypotheses have to be systematically explored through theories and experiments in a way that they could in principle be falsified | In the Harry Potter world, everyone just explains things by saying “it's magic". Harry Potter instead wants to scientifically understand them |
| Efficient market hypothesis | Prices contain all information known to the market | Gringotts and the magic world have a financial system that is separate from the muggle world, without them pricing in information from the muggle world, e.g. the price of gold |
| Arbitrage  | Making money by trading in a way that removes inefficiencies in prices. This requires some information or insight that the market has not yet priced in | Harry Potter could make lots of money in the magic world by using gold (or silver) from the muggle world to produce his own coins in the magic world |
| Fundamental attribution error | Overly attributing behavior to personality while it is really just due to situational context | People think Harry Potter's personally defeated Voldemort, even though, as far as anyone knows at the time, it might have nothing to do with Harry Potter himself |
| The planing fallacy | People are generally way more optimistic than rational estimates would demand. When asked for average and worst case estimates, people give answers that are statistically indistinguishable | Harry Potter wants to prepare for all sorts of bad things that could happen at Hogwarts. Professor McGonagall thinks all of this preparation is unnecessary  |
| Reciprocity | People are more likely to become good friends if they share something intimate with each other  | Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy become friends by sharing secrets |
| Positive bias  | We tend to think of hypotheses that confirm our existing believes. This also leads to us being biased towards experimental designs that positively confirm these hypotheses | Harry Potter gives Hermine a riddle to solve, the 2-4-6 problem. Harry tells her that 2-4-6 is a valid sequence, that there is a rule underlying valid sequences and that Hermine can test any sequence she wants before coming up with the rule. People are biased to thinking of the rule as (x, x + 2, x + 4) and only test sequences that match this |
| Consequentialism | An ethical principle that evaluates actions based on their consequences, not their intentions | Harry Potter justifies some actions this way. In particular, he considers some actions equivalent because they have equivalent outcomes |
| Bystander effect | People generally expect someone else to act. You’re more likely to get help by asking 1 person than by asking 3 people | This might be why there was so little resistance against Voldemort |
| Rationalization  | Once something happened, we come up with all sorts of reasons why it was clear this would be happening, even when before it wasn’t  |  |
| Anthropic principle (Also:  observation selection principle) | The range of observations we can make is limited by the fact that we live in a universe that was capable of developing observers  |  |
| Bayes‘ theorem  | Updating one‘s prior belief by weighting in new evidence | Professor Quirrel reasons in a way resembling Bayes‘ theorem about why Harry Potter might turn into a dark lord |
| Preference utilitarianism  | Ethical theory that says you should maximize the complete, summed happiness of people | Harry Potter explains that it might be okay to hurt someone if it’s for a greater good |
| Plausible deniability | Phrasing things in a way that you can deny possible implications in a plausible way | Professor Quirrel phrases some of his ideas in such a way |
