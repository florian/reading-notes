# Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality ([[book]](https://hpmor.com/))

(*Note: To summarize the book, I'm keeping track of all interesting concepts and the context they were mentioned in. Some concepts I was aware of before reading the book, but it's still a good practice to document them since that forces me to think through the context they were mentioned in.*)

## Volume 1: The Methods of Rationality — Chapters 1 - 21

| Concept | Explanation | Context |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The scientific method (Also: the Baconian method) | Hypotheses have to be systematically explored through theories and experiments in a way that they could in principle be falsified | In the Harry Potter world, everyone just explains things by saying “it's magic". Harry Potter instead wants to scientifically understand them |
| Efficient market hypothesis | Prices contain all information known to the market | Gringotts and the magic world have a financial system that is separate from the muggle world, without them pricing in information from the muggle world, e.g. the price of gold |
| Arbitrage  | Making money by trading in a way that removes inefficiencies in prices. This requires some information or insight that the market has not yet priced in | Harry Potter could make lots of money in the magic world by using gold (or silver) from the muggle world to produce his own coins in the magic world |
| Fundamental attribution error | Overly attributing behavior to personality while it is really just due to situational context | People think Harry Potter's personally defeated Voldemort, even though, as far as anyone knows at the time, it might have nothing to do with Harry Potter himself |
| The planing fallacy | People are generally way more optimistic than rational estimates would demand. When asked for average and worst case estimates, people give answers that are statistically indistinguishable | Harry Potter wants to prepare for all sorts of bad things that could happen at Hogwarts. Professor McGonagall thinks all of this preparation is unnecessary  |
| Reciprocity | People are more likely to become good friends if they share something intimate with each other  | Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy become friends by sharing secrets |
| Positive bias  | We tend to think of hypotheses that confirm our existing believes. This also leads to us being biased towards experimental designs that positively confirm these hypotheses | Harry Potter gives Hermine a riddle to solve, the 2-4-6 problem. Harry tells her that 2-4-6 is a valid sequence, that there is a rule underlying valid sequences and that Hermine can test any sequence she wants before coming up with the rule. People are biased to thinking of the rule as (x, x + 2, x + 4) and only test sequences that match this |
| Consequentialism | An ethical principle that evaluates actions based on their consequences, not their intentions | Harry Potter justifies some actions this way. In particular, he considers some actions equivalent because they have equivalent outcomes |
| Bystander effect | People generally expect someone else to act. You’re more likely to get help by asking 1 person than by asking 3 people | This might be why there was so little resistance against Voldemort |
| Rationalization  | Once something happened, we come up with all sorts of reasons why it was clear this would be happening, even when before it wasn’t  |  |
| Anthropic principle (Also:  observation selection principle) | The range of observations we can make is limited by the fact that we live in a universe that was capable of developing observers  |  |
| Bayes‘ theorem  | Updating one‘s prior belief by weighting in new evidence | Professor Quirrel reasons in a way resembling Bayes‘ theorem about why Harry Potter might turn into a dark lord |
| Preference utilitarianism  | Ethical theory that says you should maximize the complete, summed happiness of people | Harry Potter explains that it might be okay to hurt someone if it’s for a greater good |
| Plausible deniability | Phrasing things in a way that you can deny possible implications in a plausible way | Professor Quirrel phrases some of his ideas in such a way |

## Volume 2: The Legion of Chaos — Chapters 22-37

| Concept | Explanation | Context |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blind testing  | Test subjects are not told what exactly the test is since that would otherwise influence results  | Harry let’s Hermine try out different intonations for a spell to see if intonation matters. Hermine is not told which intonation is supposed to work  |
| Socratic method  | Explain things by asking questions, usually between teacher and student  | Harry uses this technique with Malfoy  |
| Litany of Gendlin | What is true, is so. Not acknowledging it does not make it better | Malfoy is unhappy about acknowledging results of their experiments about blood. Harry tells him not accepting the results will not make them any different  |
| Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis (also: social brain hypothesis) | Humans evolved to have larger brains because of social competition |  |
| Zero-sum game | A game in which one player can only win points by another losing the same amount | The battle magic competition at Hogwarts is such a game |
| Mutual modeling  | By predicting what the other player will do, you can better figure out which actions to take yourself  | Participants in the battle magic competition are scheming and do so at multiple levels of depth |
| Prisoner‘s dilemma | A game in which collaboration would reach a good outcome for both but both players can reach a better outcome for themselves if they defect. The problem is that you cannot trust the other player to collaborate  | Harry and Malfoy are in a Prisoner‘s Dilemma in the battle magic competition. They should collaborate to not lose but each of them could win the game by eventually defecting  |
| Newcomb‘s problem | A game in which a predictor tries to guess what action you are about to take. Your payoff depends on what action you kick and on what the predictor guessed. What you should do depends on how well you think the predictor can guess your action  | Harry references this when scheming based on mutual modeling starts  |

## Volume 3: The Shadows of Death — Chapters 38-64

| Concept | Explanation | Context |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Constrained optimization  | Minimizing or maximizing some variable while also satisfying some other constraints | Harry needs to figure out a rescue plan in Azkaban but things get more and more difficult, i.e. more and more constraints get added |
| Consistent utility values | Utility values describe how much value you assign to an option. Them being consistent means that they follow certain rules, e.g. transitivity | Harry reasons about his choices and, while it is not obvious which one to prefer, reminds himself that he should assign consistent utility values to them |
| Stanford prison experiment | A famous psychology experiment in which a prison with prisoners and guards which are played by the participants. It turns out that the participants end up doing horrible things and the experiment had to be stopped early. (Though the results have not been consistently replicated) | Harry remarks that the experiment studied the prisoners but that it would potentially have been even more interesting to study the people that voted for a system that allows prisons such as Azkaban |
| Scarcity effects | A cognitive bias that makes people assign higher values to things that are rare. Some examples from the Influence book include: (1) people only wanted to buy phosphate detergent when it was about to be banned, and suddenly deemed it superior. (2) Kids prefer toys behind a barrier instead of toys that are easily available. (3) Sales people tell customers that something might not be available to make them more interested | Harry has to stay at Hogwarts for security reasons. So far he didn't even think about wanting to be somewhere else, but now that it's not possible anymore, he really wants to |
| Milgram experiment | A famous psychology experiment on the role of authority. Experiment participants are in charge of administering electrical shocks for a student giving incorrect answers. It turns out that 97% of people administer extreme electrical shocks when told they really need to do so  | Harry remembers that Hermine was the only one to refuse the defense professor's demand to administer a hurtful spell to another student. This happened at the beginning of the series, but it only comes to mind now |
